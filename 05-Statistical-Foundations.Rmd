# Statistical Foundations of Meta-Analysis

As noted earlier in the book, I do not intend for this to be a statistics book. However, I do want you to know the foundations of the statistics used in this book. Others have written about this in a particularly approachable way. I would like to refer readers to [Doing Meta-Analysis in R: A Hands-On Guide](#0) [@harrer2021] for an introduction to the statistical foundations of meta-analysis.

Here are some more specific links:

[Pooling Effect Sizes](https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/pooling-es.html)

[Between-Study Heterogeneity](https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/heterogeneity.html)

[Meta-Regression](https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/metareg.html)

The book [Doing Meta-Analysis in R: A Hands-On Guide](#0) [@harrer2021] has a number of great chapters on advanced meta-analytic methods as well, I really suggest taking some time to time to read the book!
